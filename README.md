## 🎯 Final Thoughts

This project has been both a rewarding and challenging exploration into retail sales analytics. Working with a multi-table relational dataset pushed me to think critically about data structure, relationships, and SQL query optimization. Constructing insights required complex joins, aggregations, and filtering across up to four tables at a time, which significantly strengthened my SQL proficiency and analytical thinking. Beyond technical skills, this analysis transformed raw sales data into a clear narrative of customer behavior, product performance, and business potential—providing a solid foundation for smarter, data-driven decision making in retail environments.
